# CSPrep
Initial Commit

Import project to Android Studio. In the build.gradle make sure the compileSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion is 22. Allow the Gradle to finish syncing, then press the run (“play”) button. Use the default emulator (“Nexus 5”) or an equivalent Android phone running at least API 21 but preferably API 22 (lollipop). When the project is finally loaded on the emulator/phone, click on the CSPrep app.
